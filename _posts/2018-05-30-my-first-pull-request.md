In my Things I Learned Today post, while talking about a bit of documentation, I said

> I wish the Jekyll docs made this a bit more explicit.  

Lucky for us, the Jekyll team wants people to help clarify the documentation and they've tried to make it pretty painless. Yay!

In order to update the docs I clicked on the 'Improve this page' link at the top of the [working with drafts page.](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/drafts/ "Jekyll drafts docs") This took me to a github [page](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/edit/master/docs/_docs/drafts.md "Github edit page") that asked me to fork the repository to propose changes. I clicked the big green button. And voila!, I had a page where I could edit the text so that it's more clear what the definition of a draft is. I added the three words "in the filename," wrote a quick description and hit the big green "Propose file change" button. 

This took me to a page where I could create the pull request that would eventually lead to my words being included in the official documentation. To create the pull request I hit the big green "Create pull request" button, added a comment about the change I made and why.  

> Made it more clear that there shouldn't be a date in the filename. This was confusing to me as I thought it meant that there shouldn't be a date in the front matter. It took me awhile to figure out that I just needed to not put a date on the filename.

Then I clicked the merge button! Yikes! Now I wait...

The whole process was, for me, incredibly painless and easy to do. After creating the pull request I was greeted and thanked by the reviewers, which makes me feel all sorts of welcomed and I look forward to continuing to make contributions. 

My pull request was merged about 24 hours later. Very cool.

*This isn't my actual first pull request. I've done them while working on a group project, within my own repos, and as part of project meant for people's first pull requests. But this is the first one I've done for a large project used by a lot of people.
