title: "How to make a jekyll theme with lots of words in the title"
---

### Notes
1. use theme installer
2. add basic html to default layout
3. create a home.html in _layouts
4. create a list of posts on home
5. needed to do a bunch of setup stuff, ended up copy/pasting minima theme config and adjusting
6. create sample pages and posts (now is a good time to make and about page)
7. header
8. footer


* I use a lot of the minima theme structure
* index.html uses home layout - file is empty otherwise


## Questions
* what does 'escape' in site title do? (home.html)
* how to enable post excerpts?
