## Confusing Resources are Confusing

When I first started transitioning to web development I went looking around for resources I could use to learn. There are so many amazing resources out there but I discovered a couple of things:

1. A lot of the free resources are awful. 
2. A lot of the obviously good resources aren't free. 
    
So many of the free resources are just awful and at first it's really hard to tell the difference between them. I spent sooo many hours trying to follow tutorials when learning things like webpack before realizing that the tutorial was 3 years old and the technology had changed so much that I couldn't follow the tutorial with my limited knowledge. While learning to tell the difference between a good tutorial and a bad one is great experience, not all of us have the time to waste on learning the hard way. 

A lot of the obviously good resources aren't free. (Nor should they be. We all deserve to get paid for our work). By obviously good resources, I mean the ones that are clearly using up to date tech, have been created within the last couple of years (important when we're talking something like Angular), are easy to listen to/read, have captions, etc. Those are the easy to see factors that can indicate to someone new to the field that 'This tutorial/set of instructions/book won't be a waste of time.' What's harder is figuring out whether or not it will be a waste of money.

## What to do then?

For me, the [San Francisco Public Library](https://sfpl.org/ "SFPL") has been a lifesaver there. I found out that the SFPL gets me free access to all the courses and content on both [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/ "Treehouse") and [Lynda](https://www.lynda.com/ "Lynda.com"). As well as access to thousands of tech books. I don't have to leave my desk to do any of these things. Even better, I don't have to live in San Francisco to get this awesome feature. They give a library card to anyone who lives in California. The New York Public Library has similar offerings though I don't know all of the specifics. But they also give you a card as long as you live in the state. So be sure to check out what the closest metropolitan library offers if you live in-state. Sadly, the Indianapolis Public Library only services those who live in Marion County. You mileage may vary on this, but it can't hurt to check out!

Using Treehouse especially I could go through the basics of a new tech and get enough knowledge to then utilize other resources and be able to tell quickly whether or not it was going to be a waste of my time or money.
